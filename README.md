# social-network-api


  ## Description
  I built a sample api for a social network.  You are able to create/update/delete a profile, create/update/delete thoughts(posts), you are able to respond/update/delete your response to other peoples posts, and you are able to add and delete friends.  The project was done for me to gain a better understanding of how Mongoose and noSQL databases work while applying real life scenarios such as a social networking website.
